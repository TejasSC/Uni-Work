PART 2 INTRO
Knowledge Bases: The Basics
- set of sentences in a formal language
- Declarative method for agent construction: what does agent need to understand?
- Based on this new KB, what answers can agent derive?
- Agents viewable in two ways
  1. Knowledge level (what they know, don't care about implementation)
  2. implementation level (KB's data structures and manipulating algorithms)

What does a KB Agent do?
- Represent actions, states...
- Take in fresh percepts
- Modify internal representations and identify hidden properties of the world
- Deduce appropriate actions
! From all this, possibility of sound and complete reasoning with partial
information states

Aims with KB agents in general: design agents with pre-existing knowledge, but
they try to learn more.
- Learning methods must first exist for them to HAVE the background knowledge
