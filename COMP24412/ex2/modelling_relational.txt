How could my extensional relations be represented as tables?
- Four columns correspond to facts: saxophone, trumpet, trombone, rhythm
- Table therefore has 4 subtables/columns

How could my intensional relations be represented as queries?
- rules such as horn(X) would be translated to use nested select statements
  gathering different raw tables, e.g. saxophone, trumpet, trombone

- rules such as rhythmSection(X) and hornsSection(S,T,B) would use more
  arithmetic functions as well as nested queries (e.g. to check if the rhythm
  section has 4 distinct instruments, the keywords COUNT and DISTINCT would be
  used)

- Since rules like allRhythm and allHorns are recursive, it would be easier
  in SQL to write equiavlant iterative functions
