What happens if you donâ€™t allocate a big enough space for your string?
- Will only give segfault error if no gap between string and occupied memory,
  otherwise no error given due to likely unused writeable memory between string
  and occupied memory
What problem (if any) might you have if you miss out the free() call?
- No problem, lots of memory to spare for future runs of the program
