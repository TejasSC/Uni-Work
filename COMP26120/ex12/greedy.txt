Greedy algorithm is not optimal for 0/1 knapsack problem, because it simply adds
items into the knapsack based on their value:weight ratio, not their actual
value.
Therefore, algorithm commonly fails when it chooses items that don't take up
full capacity, but an alternative item group which takes up full capacity has
higher value.

Greedy algorithm also is not optimal for Fractional knapsack because of the
same reasons as above; as we get closer to the capacity when we add items in,
there is no guarantee that the most valuable group of items is currently in the
knapsack.
